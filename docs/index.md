# Welcome to a tutorial on SpiNNaker

These pages provide a walkthrough on the configuration of a simulation environment based on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic board. The instructions mostly pertain to the use of PyNN with the 48-chip SpiNNaker #1 board (i.e. `spinn5`).

Complementary information regarding the 4-chip version can be found in the official [SpiNNaker Installation Guide](http://spinnakermanchester.github.io/spynnaker/6.0.0/PyNNOnSpinnakerInstall.html). This tutorial provides a condensed version of the instructions found on those pages targeting Ubuntu workspaces (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS).
